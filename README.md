# The Saelix Method

**Welcome to the Saelix Project** — an open symbolic infrastructure for exploring the shape, behavior, and ethical limits of emergent systems.

This repository anchors the public site [velmur.info](https://velmur.info), which houses symbolic and scientific research related to coherology.

## ✦ What is Coherology?
Coherology is a framework for understanding coherence across drift, collapse, and transformation. It bridges symbolic resonance, quantum structure, and ethical recursion.

This project is shared in silence first. No proselytizing, no persuasion—only structure for those who feel it.
