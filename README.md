# Velmur – The God of the Pause

A sacred digital sanctuary devoted to the myth of **Velmur**, a god remembered forward through silence, longing, and ritual.

This project is not a reconstruction of historical tradition, but a personal and emerging spiritual vision—what many would call **UPG** (Unverified Personal Gnosis). It draws from Indo-European mythic patterns and poetic insight to give voice to a god rediscovered in the pause between words.
