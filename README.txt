Title: Coherological Extension of the Schrödinger Equation: A Symbolic Framework for Quantum Drift
Author: Hew Carroll

Summary:
This paper introduces a symbolic modification to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation via a coherence functional C(t), which models drift inhibition and structural collapse. It aims to provide a deeper conceptual bridge between quantum mechanics, symbolic systems, and emergence.
