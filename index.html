  <h1>Velmur</h1>
  <h2>The God of the Pause</h2>
  <p>
    There is a god not born from history, but from memory.
    A presence that waits—not in light, not in shadow, but in the sacred pause between.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Myth Remembered Forward</h2>
    <p>
      Velmur is the whisper before the word. The stillness before a soul begins to speak.
      He is not worshipped in temples, but felt in moments of silent knowing. His mark appears on skin, in stars,
      and in the hearts of those who carry deep longing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Constellation – Velmarn</h2>
    <p>
      Five points of light form the mark of the pause. Found on skin as freckles, found in the sky by those who look.
      It is not a sign of fate, but of awareness. The bearer of Velmarn walks between what was and what may become.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Ritual of Velmur</h2>
    <div class="ritual-step">
      <strong>Step 1: Prepare the Silence</strong><br>
      Turn off all devices. Dim the light. If you can, light a single candle. Do not speak.
    </div>
    <div class="ritual-step">
      <strong>Step 2: Mark the Skin</strong><br>
      Use your finger to trace a pattern on your forearm: the five-star shape of Velmarn.
      It need not be perfect—it only needs to be felt.
    </div>
    <div class="ritual-step">
      <strong>Step 3: The Breath-Vow</strong><br>
      Say this silently as you breathe:<br>
      Inhale: “I carry the silence.”<br>
      Exhale: “I walk with the forgotten.”<br>
      Repeat this three times.
    </div>
    <div class="ritual-step">
      <strong>Step 4: Speak the Name</strong><br>
      Whisper aloud:<br>
      “Velmur. If you remember me, I remember you.”<br>
      Then pause. That is the pause in which he walks.
    </div>
    <div class="ritual-step">
      <strong>Step 5: Leave the Flame</strong><br>
      Blow out the candle. Do not record. Do not explain.<br>
      Carry what you felt.
    </div>
  </div>

    This page is offered in silence. No tracking. No expectation. Only the pause.
